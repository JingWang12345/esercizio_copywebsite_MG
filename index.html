        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I’m an experienced individual contributor with a broad technological repertoire: a jack of many trades that
            has mastered a few. Not only can I contribute to architecture design and implement new features, but I’m
            also a relentless debugger, doing whatever it takes to troubleshoot bugs others might dismiss as unsolvable.

        <h2>Tools, Languages, and Frameworks</h2>
        <p>I started my professional career as a developer of Windows desktop applications and dabbled in UNIX-like
            systems and FOSS in my free time, but that private dabbling has served me in good stead as I’ve transitioned
            to a full-stack developer.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>When I’m not working, I enjoy reading/writing speculative fiction, tinkering with UNIX-like systems, building hand-made static websites (like this one), learning French, weightlifting, listening to jazz/European classical music/progressive rock/heavy metal, and playing video games (mainly RPGs). I still sometimes play the bass guitar and viola, and I’ve heard all the jokes about the latter.</p>

        <h2>How to Hire Me</h2>
        <p>I currently have a stable job that pays reasonably well for my locale, but I’m open to a better deal. If you’re looking to hire, please provide the following information so that I can make an informed decision and do further research to learn about your company.</p>

        <h2>Compensation</h2>
        <p>I’m only open to positions that meet one of the following minimums depending on Federal income tax filing status.</p>

        <h2>Location Preferences</h2>
        <p>I was mostly remote before the COVID-19 lockdowns began and have since become accustomed to being entirely remote. You will find me extremely reluctant to take on a “hybrid” position requiring more than one day per week on-site, and I will not apply for 100% in-office roles at all if I have any choice in the matter.

            Being a developer, I have found that face-to-face collaboration is generally more useful to managers. As a developer I prefer written communication where I can include code snippets or screenshots.</p>

        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        <p>I originally registered this domain in 2013 to help promote my then-upcoming first novel, Without Bloodshed. I’ve repurposed the domain to host the sort of information others in my trade would put on LinkedIn, but I see no reason to use that platform when I’m perfectly capable of building my own website.</p>
